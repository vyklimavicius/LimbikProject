- Limbik Technical Assignment

You have been provided an index.json file that contains parsed out data from the set posts flagged as Russian interference into the United States 2016 election. You are to create a simple analysis tool to allow a user to search, examine and compare the data. 

You will be expected to complete the following requirements:
	- You are to display the data for single or multiple files.
	- You are to allow a user to search for a single file based on file id.
	- You are to allow a user to filter data based on any of the targeting properties. These are not uniform so you will have to consider this when meeting this requirement (you can ignore any nested objects meaning you only need to look through arrays and strings. You can only look at the first layer of properties as well). 
	- You are to allow a user to sort the data by number of clicks or impressions in both ascending or descending order. 

Any additional analysis tools you think will help demonstrate your skills feel free to add and showcase.

You will need to decide how you will store the data and how you plan to access it. 

You will need to decide how you will visualize the data. Put some consideration into this as effective design and strong user experience is an important consideration for any good developer.

You may complete this project using any language or framework you prefer but as we are mainly a javascript company preference will be for use of NodeJs and React.

We ask that you give all requirements a meaningful try as the purpose of this assignment is to display your ability to us. The more you can display these skills the better we are able to assess if Limbik is a good fit for you and you for us.

You will need to upload your project and any code you used to a public GitHub repo complete with a read me that explains how to run your project. Also include in the read me any packages you used and a description about why you used each one.

Once done we ask that you send us the GitHub link to your project for us to review and we will be in touch about setting up an opportunity for you to go over you code with us and demonstrate in the running program how you met the requirements. 

Keep in mind that the assignment is open ended by design to help us get a sense of how you think through problems. That said, should you need clarification on the assignment feel free to contact us.

Good Luck and look forward to seeing your awesome code!
